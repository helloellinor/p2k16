# P2K16 Migration Roadmap: Python Flask ‚Üí Go + HTMX

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the transition roadmap from the legacy Python/Flask backend to the new Go-based system with HTMX frontend. The migration aims to modernize the codebase, improve performance, and maintain functionality while enabling easier maintenance and development.

## üéØ Migration Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Modernize Technology Stack**: Replace Flask with Go (Gin framework) + HTMX
- **Improve Performance**: Leverage Go's concurrency and compilation benefits
- **Maintain Feature Parity**: Ensure all existing functionality is preserved
- **Database Compatibility**: Use existing PostgreSQL schema without breaking changes
- **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Run both systems in parallel during transition

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All Python features migrated to Go
- ‚úÖ No data loss during migration
- ‚úÖ Performance improvements measurable
- ‚úÖ Maintainer knowledge transfer complete
- ‚úÖ Old Python codebase can be safely retired

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Parallel Deployment
Both systems will run simultaneously during migration:

```
Production Environment:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Python Flask (Port 5000) - Legacy system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Go Server (Port 8080) - New system  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PostgreSQL Database (Shared)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Nginx Load Balancer - Route by feature
```

### Feature-by-Feature Migration
1. **Route Shadowing**: New Go routes shadow Python routes
2. **A/B Testing**: Gradually shift traffic to Go endpoints
3. **Rollback Capability**: Immediate fallback to Python if issues arise
4. **Data Consistency**: Shared database ensures no data loss

### Migration Commands
```bash
# Start both systems for development
make dev-python  # Starts Flask on :5000
make dev-go      # Starts Go on :8080

# Production deployment
docker-compose -f docker/migration.yml up  # Both services
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Go unit tests for all handlers and repositories
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Database integration testing
- [ ] **API Compatibility Tests**: Ensure API parity between Python and Go
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Performance comparison between systems

### Manual Testing
- [ ] **Feature Parity Testing**: Manual verification of all features
- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing**: Stakeholder validation
- [ ] **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization verification
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: HTMX frontend testing

### Testing Tools
```bash
# Run Go tests
make test

# API compatibility testing
npm run test-api-compat

# Load testing
artillery run load-test.yml
```
